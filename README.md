# WindowsBloatwareUninstaller
A simple program to provide a list of all programs installed on a windows machine, including those prepackaged and hidden from the user, and give the user the ability to uninstall them if they so wish.

I take no responsibility for any errors that happen as a result of using this program. Always double check what it is you are trying to meddle with and keep a list of what you uninstall, just in case. 
This program is currently in beta. It is functional but requires a lot of manual oversight. This may be addressed in the future.
